                Hello, My name is
                <span class="name">Binod Tiwari.</span> 
                  I love many things, but, somehow I have build up quite an interest in web development more than anything else , at least for now. When I started out, last year, I was quite unsure of which programming language was the best fit for me, I wasn’t even sure if programming itself was for me, because I didn’t know what would I be able make after I learn them or even what would I want to build. All I knew was doing programming is quite a build up process, and it had potential of being a fire in my  hand. I never knew how powerful that fire could be. How it can burn my fingers sometimes is something I have learnt quite recently.
            </p>
            <p class="second">I just jumped, since I knew I wouldn’t want my brains to crack, the easiest language to learn that was also somewhat enterprise was python. After reading a single article somewhere, I was forced from every direction to learn python and so I did. It wasn’t a bad experience. I actually loved my journey. But last year, just somedays after I started my journey, we went to my hometown and there was a corona lockdown. I had no internet access. All I had to do was to read 5 pdfs that I downloaded. It actually helped me read books. I actually went from someone who dreaded books to its lover during that time. After 3 months  there, one of my uncle made internet access in their home. After that I went there and downloaded all sorts of videos, pdfs, packages, and I tried to learn everything in my bid. After quite sometime I pasturized myself and knew that I had to do this. </p> 
            <p class="third">But, even after reading for long time(4 months), I realized very late that what should I actually be doing is not to learn every regex format, and try to memorize every string methods, or memorize every meta functions from an old pdf of 11 years ago of which many code actually threw depreciated warnings, many didn’t even worked. I was actually reading wrong books. Then I came accross books that were quite project-oriented and that was the time when I met words like data science, or, Web Development, Game, I first time heard about Kivy, Pygame, numpy, pandas, all those packages that were famous for what they did. Then Django, I have to admit Django, I hated it. I love it now. I thought django was hard, but, I never knew it was hard because it had too many features to learn. A fully secure web development framework. Ha, such a buzzword. But, for having the knowledge of at least HTML,  CSS and some amount of javascript was also a definite prerequisite. And for me, everything was completely new. Nevertheless, I knew I had to, I got to.</p>   
            <p class="fourth">
                After some days of learning or so I returned after more that 6 months in village after lockdown.  I then stood myself to learn frontend, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. Then I learned about SVGs after I heard about them, I learnt about some amount of manupulation of rasterized images. Some amount of UI UX design. Some amount of version control, not in the best way possible, but, I did.
            </p>
            <p class="fifth">
                After learning all of these factions and heeds for more than 5 months(I am a really slow learner.). I returned to my same old Django, and have been learning from last February. I only have recently been exposed to REST, and why is it important. I am currently studying the basics of database.

                And It seems so abstract that I have come preety far, not intellectually, but as myself, I know a little bit more of me. I am and will be more than happy if I can be sure that I am me.  Asides, I still remember myself querring into solving my first strategic  <span class="queen">8 QUEEN’S PROBLEM</span> . To be honest the code is just jumbled up, but, I know what I did, I wrote ideas.
